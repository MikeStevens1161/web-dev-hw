          <p>
            I absolutely love this book. It is extremely well written and entertaining
            all the way through.This book makes you feel for the characters like few books
            I've ever read. It has a nice steady pace throughout the entirety of the book.
            While a couple parts are predictable, they are predictable for a reason... everyone
            wants them to happen. On the opposite end, some parts I never would have seen coming.
            Those were the best parts of the book to me. This book is over 800 pages long and
            I still didn't want it to end.
