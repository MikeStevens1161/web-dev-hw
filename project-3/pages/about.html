        <h2>About The Author</h2>
        <div class="paragraph-1">
          <p>
  Terry Goodkind was born in 1948, and his home town was Omaha, Nebraska. Because he has dyslexia, he found little interest in school, and therefore has no formal education.
  In 1983, Goodkind moved with his wife Jeri to a house he built in Maine and later made his residence on the coast of Lake Las Vegas, Nevada his primary home.
  Goodkind has dyslexia, which initially dissuaded him from any interest in writing. Before starting his career as a writer, Goodkind built cabinets and violins, and
  was a marine and wildlife artist, selling his paintings in galleries. In 1993, during the construction of his and Jeri's home on the forested Mount Desert Island,
  off the coast of Maine, he began to write his first novel, Wizard's First Rule, and his writing career was launched with its publication in 1994.

               People are stupid. They will believe a lie because they want to believe it's true,
               or because they are afraid it might be true.
