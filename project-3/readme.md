This week I decided to do my project on Terry Goodkind's book Wizards First Rule. Most of my work Ill get from the web and the book since I have a copy for myself. I will give a break biograpy of the auther for the information i gather on the web.
The Colors Im going to Use are As follows:#5DCFA6,#E7C507,#5B6F33,#654E34,#13100B. I picked these by getting a color scheme from the book cover.

Week 8

This week i used the color scheme i Picked out last week and added the pictures and font i needed. The font to be honest I pick by searching for what is the best font to use in web design in of effectiveness and looks and most used. I then decided to go with lato, and Alegreya one being serif and one sans serif. Then put everything togeather
