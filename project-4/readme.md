for this project the information trying to delever is answering the questions that were asked of me. the first information that should draw the eye should be the first question. the primary content is the boxes with the questions and secondary is how they are set up. I really only anded one background image. This assignment was a bit confusing as to what it is that was wanted. I made it so everything ajusted on the site but and answed the questions but as for breakpoints i wasn't seeing what i needed them for when the content is just a bunch of questions to answer.
