**Seconed Weeks Tasks**

This week was probably one of the most annoying weeks I've had in reguards to coding. It seems like every time I fixed one problem another one would pop up. The biggest problem I faced this week was I couldn't get my images to show up in my table the after going over the work for what seemed like a dozen times I realised i had put the folders for my computer and not the present directory so github couldn't find my images. Now feel like a complete idiot for freaking out about it.

**Third Weeks Tasks**
This weeks tasks I've enjoyed. I didn't have too many problems with the code itself mostly just my directories.
It seems I had the wrong names for some of the directories When i was uploding the videos but in the end I figured it out.
I look forward to whats next.
